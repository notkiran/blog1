This is the demo and documentation for Oinam Jekyll Theme. The [Styleguide]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/styleguide/) has the demonstation of all content features and options you can use. I wrote [an article](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/) about how and why I built this Jekyll Theme.

> The [source](https://github.com/oinam/oinam-jekyll) is hosted on Github and you can [download](https://github.com/oinam/oinam-jekyll/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) a zipped version of the source code.

## Installation

There are three ways of using Oinam Jekyll Theme;

1. Remote Theme
2. Template
3. Ruby Gem

### Remote Theme (Preferred)

Use `oinam-jekyll` as a [remote theme](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) and you should be good to go. Add `remote_theme: oinam/oinam-jekyll` in the `_config.yml` file.

This is the preferred option. You get updates as soon as a new feature is added or bugs are fixed and updated on Github. You also get the latest versions.
